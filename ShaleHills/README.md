# The Shale Hills Watershed
**Location:** 40.66 &deg;N, 77.91 &deg;W<br>
**Total area:** 0.08 km<sup>2</sup><br>
**Number of triangular grids:** 535<br>
**Number of river segments:** 20

## Topography
![Topography](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/PIHM-Simulations/blob/master/ShaleHills/images/topo.png "Topography")
The surface terrain map was measured using an airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) with 1-m horizontal resolution.

## Soil
![Soil](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/PIHM-Simulations/blob/master/ShaleHills/images/soil.png "Soil")
The soil map was produced from a field campaign conducted in 2003.
The soil hydraulic properties were measured by Lin (2006)<sup>[[1]](#Lin2006)</sup> and Baldwin (2011)<sup>[[2]](#Baldwin2011)</sup>.

## Land cover
![Land cover](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/PIHM-Simulations/blob/master/ShaleHills/images/lc.png "Land cover")
The vegetation map was obtained from a tree survey conducted in 2008.

## Forcing
Precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed data were measured in the watershed. 
Downward longwave radiation, downward solar radiation, and surface pressure (prior to April 2009) were obtained from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) Penn State University station. 
Surface pressure data from April 2009 were measured from the flux tower in the watershed.
MODIS LAI data were rescaled based on the comparison between the MODIS product and the CZO field measurements<sup>[[3]](#ShiEA2003)</sup>.
